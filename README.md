# Personal Portfolio

[**View Live Portfolio**](https://aleksacekic.com)

A modern, fully responsive personal portfolio built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase my work, skills, and personal brand with clean UI/UX, subtle animations, and a focus on performance and accessibility.

The goal of this portfolio is to provide a polished and professional overview of my projects, experience, and interests while keeping the design minimal, elegant, and aligned with my preferred themes.
